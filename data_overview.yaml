overview: |
  Hourly measurements of electricity load (consumption) and price signals for Egypt.
  Suitable for short-term load forecasting, price prediction, consumption pattern
  analysis, and electricity bill estimation.
  
  In this project, we focus on calculating and predicting **electricity bills**. The approach involves:
  1. Using historical load (`L(T)`, `L(T-1)`, etc.) and price (`P(T-1)`, `P(T-2)`, etc.) data to estimate total electricity usage.
  2. Computing the **monthly electricity bill** using price and load formulas.
  3. Training a regression model to **predict future electricity bills** based on usage patterns and pricing history.
structure:
  - column: "L(T)"
    description: "Load at current hour (used in bill calculation)"
    example: 1125.7
  - column: "L(T-1)"
    description: "Load 1 hour ago"
    example: 1098.3
  - column: "L(T-2)"
    description: "Load 2 hours ago"
    example: 1104.2
  - column: "L(T-24)"
    description: "Load 24 hours ago (same hour yesterday)"
    example: 1189.6
  - column: "L(T-48)"
    description: "Load 48 hours ago (same hour 2 days ago)"
    example: 1211.2
  - column: "P(T-1)"
    description: "Price 1 hour ago"
    example: 0.145
  - column: "P(T-2)"
    description: "Price 2 hours ago"
    example: 0.148
  - column: "P(T-24)"
    description: "Price 24 hours ago"
    example: 0.152
  - column: "P(T-48)"
    description: "Price 48 hours ago"
    example: 0.140
  - column: "Day"
    description: "Day of week (1=Mon .. 7=Sun)"
    example: 5
  - column: "Season"
    description: "Season indicator (1=Winter .. 4=Autumn)"
    example: 2
data_quality:
  rows_estimate: "~20k-100k (typical subsets ~30k+)"
  missing_values: "None significant / small — verify per subset"
  frequency: "Hourly"
  period: "Covers multiple months (check dataset metadata for exact range)"
  notes: |
    - Check for timezone and DST assumptions when aligning timestamps.
    - Verify units (MW or kW) depending on dataset subset.
project_usage:
  project: "Electricity Bill Prediction"
  target_variable: "Electricity Bill (calculated from load and price)"
  features:
    - "L(T-1)"
    - "L(T-2)"
    - "L(T-24)"
    - "L(T-48)"
    - "P(T-1)"
    - "P(T-2)"
    - "P(T-24)"
    - "P(T-48)"
    - "Day"
    - "Season"
  goal: |
    Compute and predict the **monthly electricity bill** using historical consumption and pricing data.
    The bill is derived by combining load and price information to estimate cost per hour and then aggregating over time.

  # Example: average daily load trend
  import seaborn as sns
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  df_grouped = df.groupby('Hour')['L(T)'].mean().reset_index()
  sns.lineplot(data=df_grouped, x='Hour', y='L(T)')
  plt.title('Average Hourly Load')
  plt.show()

additional_notes: |
  - This YAML describes the data used to calculate and predict electricity bills.
  - Keep this file in the `data/` folder for documentation.
  - Update `rows_estimate` and `period` once you confirm the dataset subset.
  - You can later include a formula reference for how the bill is calculated (e.g., `Bill = Load × Price`).
