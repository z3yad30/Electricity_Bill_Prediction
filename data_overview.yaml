Data Overview:
  Description: >
    This dataset is synthetic and was generated to simulate household and commercial
    electricity billing patterns across multiple Egyptian governorates. 
    It includes environmental, geographic, and structural building features 
    to support machine learning models predicting monthly electricity bills.

  Source: >
    Synthetic dataset generated by the project team using randomized statistical 
    distributions and domain-inspired logic. No real customer data was used.

  Purpose: >
    To train and evaluate machine learning models that estimate 
    electricity bill amounts based on building type, location, and environmental factors.

  Records: 30,000
  File Name: synthetic_electricity_bills_30k.csv

  Target Variable:
    - bill_amount: Total monthly bill (EGP) for the given record.

  Features:
    - governorate: Egyptian governorate where the building is located.
    - city: City within the governorate.
    - building_type: Type of building (Apartment, Villa, or Office).
    - rooms: Number of rooms in the building.
    - month: Numeric month (1–12) representing the billing period.
    - season: Season derived from the month (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn).
    - temperature: Average external temperature during the billing period (°C).
    - price_per_kwh: Electricity cost per kilowatt-hour for that region (EGP).
    - tax_rate: Applied electricity tax rate (fractional).
    - consumption_kwh: Total electricity consumption (kWh) for that month.

  Bill Calculation:
    Formula: bill_amount = consumption_kwh * price_per_kwh * (1 + tax_rate)

  Notes:
    - Data is synthetic and should be used for modeling and educational purposes only.
    - Assumptions include average tariffs, seasonal temperature variation, 
      and region-based tax differences.
    - Random seed was fixed for reproducibility (seed=42).
